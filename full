UNTOUCHABLE.
A BULLY ROMANCE
BY SAM MARIANO.

I have very much enjoyed Carter and Zoey’s story, so I hope you will
too, but I want to make sure I’ve prepared/warned you adequately. ;) Carter
Mahoney is not for the faint of heart.

CHAPTER 1
HIGH SCHOOLS and small towns have a lot in common. Groups of
people in their own separate tribes, forced together arbitrarily, made to
coexist in order to achieve optimal pleasantness. Not everybody actually
likes everyone else, but most days, that doesn’t matter. Most days, you
might experience at worst a tightening smile, a twinge of annoyance when
someone nudges your comfort zone, challenges you just enough to wake
you up and make you notice.
