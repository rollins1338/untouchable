Please, please take me seriously when I say this is a BULLY romance.
This book contains some dark shit, and if you have sexual
violence/abuse triggers, this may not be a good fit for you. I know where
the characters’ limits are, but you know your own sensitivities much better
than I do.
Carter Mahoney is not a comfortable hero, and this is not always a
comfortable love story. If you need safe, good-guy heroes in every romance
you read, this is not the story for you. These characters have their own
unique damage, needs, desires, and proficiencies, and they are seeking out
partners who fit them as they are, not partners who need them to change and
be something they’re not.
I have very much enjoyed Carter and Zoey’s story, so I hope you will
too, but I want to make sure I’ve prepared/warned you adequately. ;) Carter
Mahoney is not for the faint of heart.
